In this project I have implemented a Trie Class

Project has following folder tree

test_Trie.cpp       : Tests implemented

Code has been written using VSCODE through jupyter lab and set up just like our problem sets.

To compile and run the code, load the files into VSCODE, run the cmake from the build folder, and then run the tests. View the code in the code folder and the tests in the tests folder. 

There will be an option during one of the tests to visually inspect the output for the testprint case. entering 1 will confirm that the output is the same. Tests will continue.
